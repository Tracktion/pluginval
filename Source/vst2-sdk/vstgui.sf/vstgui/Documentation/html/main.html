<h1>VSTGUI Documentation</h1>
<p>
Welcome to VSTGUI 3.0!<p>
Providing an interface to your Plug-In makes you be immediately confronted with platform specifics of different windows handling and event handling models. For this very reason, the <b>VSTGUI</b> libraries have been created. These are available for all supported platforms and make the handling of user interaction with a graphic-rich user interface also cross-platform. Thus they propose common objects for plugs's GUI, like <b>knobs</b>, <b>sliders</b> ...and of course nothing prevents you from adding via inheritance any more specific components you should need.<p>
You can contribute to <b>VSTGUI</b> development thru Sourceforge project (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vstgui/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/vstgui/</a>). You can join the associated mailing list (check <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/vstgui-devel">https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/vstgui-devel</a>)<p>
